Are there standards for building a HISTORY.md file?



Thereâ€™s no formal specification for `HISTORY.md`, but there are widely adopted conventions that make it useful and readable â€” especially in open source projects. Itâ€™s essentially a changelog, and many developers follow the Keep a Changelog format, which is a community-driven standard for documenting changes over time.

### ðŸ“˜ Common Structure for `HISTORY.md`

Hereâ€™s a typical layout:

markdown

```
# History / Changelog

## [1.2.0] - 2025-08-22
### Added
- Support for FAT32 detection
- `--json` output mode for scripting

### Fixed
- Incorrect timestamp decoding for leap years
- Memory leak when reading large root directories

## [1.1.0] - 2025-07-10
### Changed
- Improved error messages for invalid BPB values

## [1.0.0] - 2025-06-01
### Added
- Initial release with FAT12/16 root directory listing
```

### âœ… Best Practices

- **Chronological Order**: Most recent version at the top.
- **Semantic Versioning**: Use semver like `1.2.0`, `1.1.0`, etc.
- **Categorize Changes**: Use headers like `Added`, `Changed`, `Fixed`, `Removed`.
- **Dates**: Include release dates for context.
- **Link to Issues/PRs**: If hosted on GitHub, link to relevant pull requests or issues.

### ðŸ§  Bonus Tips

- If your project uses Git tags, you can auto-generate parts of the changelog using tools like `git log` or `github_changelog_generator`.
- If you want to keep it minimal, even a simple bullet list per version is fine â€” just stay consistent.
