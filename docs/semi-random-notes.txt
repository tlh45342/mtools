Consider this notes to be:


### 🛠️ Sample usage

```
mdel -i floppy.img FOO.TXT
```

Note:

- This implementation assumes FAT12/FAT16 where the root directory is in a fixed location.
- It does **not** currently support subdirectories or FAT32 root in data clusters.
- File name matching is simplistic. A more robust approach would normalize the 8.3 format more carefully.

## ✅ Example 1: Create a 4MB FAT12/16 disk image

```
dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img bs=1k count=4096
```

Then:

```
mformat -i floppy.img
```

> Assumes the default is FAT12 or FAT16 based on image size and implementation logic.
